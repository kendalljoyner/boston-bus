# Project Title: Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description of Project: 
This assignment in the web development section of the MIT xPro Professional Coding Certificate program taught us how to incorporate powerful API’s into our code to make robust, real-world applications. In this particular project, we generated a map using the Mapbox API and added the coordinates of the bus route between Harvard and MIT, allowing us to see each stop on the map. In experimenting with the different capabilities of the Mapbox API, I decided to use a satellite view of the map.

## How to Run: 
Simply click the “Show stops between MIT and Harvard” button on the top left corner of the page to see the marker move along the bus route. In order to repeat the function, you will need to reload the page.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
I plan to put a “Show stops between Harvard and MIT” button that shows the reverse route. Additionally, I would like to give users the option to play the bus route on loop. Finally, I would like to change the setting to Chicago, where I live, in order to see the bus route that I routinely use.
